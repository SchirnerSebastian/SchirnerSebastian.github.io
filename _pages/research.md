### MIGRATION SHOCKS, ELECTIONS, AND POLITICAL SELECTION
with Zohal Hessami

**Abstract**
Does the sudden arrival of a new wave of immigrants distort the electoral performance of local council candidates with an immigrant background? We combine hand-collected candidate-level data on council elections (2001-2021) with detailed administrative data on asylum seekers across Hessian municipalities. We infer candidates’ immigrant background from their names via existing machine learning classification tools. Using a difference-indifferences strategy with a continuous treatment (change in the share of asylum seekers per municipality), we find that candidates with an immigrant background benefit from the
arrival of relatively large numbers of asylum seekers such as in late 2015. Further results show that this effect exists exclusively for candidates with a Southern or Eastern European background which are culturally and ethnically relatively similar to native Germans.

### CAN YOUNG POLITICIANS INFLUENCE POLICY IN A GERONTOCRACY?
with Thushyanthan Baskaran and Zohal Hessami

**Abstract**
Does the under-representation of young people in the political class harm the interests of the young? We study this question using hand-collected candidate-level data on municipal elections (1996-2020) and detailed administrative data on municipal spending from Bavaria. Our identification strategy is based on within-party candidate-level races for marginal seats. We find that municipalities with a higher share of young councilors spend more on social protection (a budget item that includes public child care and is thus arguably valued by young inhabitants). We also show that the shift towards social spending
is due to young councilors placing related topics on the agenda of local councils. Thus, the under-representation of the young in the political class appears to be detrimental to their interests.
