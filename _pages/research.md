## MIGRATION SHOCKS, ELECTIONS, AND POLITICAL SELECTION

### Abstract
Does the sudden arrival of a new wave of immigrants distort the electoral performance
of local council candidates with an immigrant background? We combine hand-collected
candidate-level data on council elections (2001-2021) with detailed administrative data on
asylum seekers across Hessian municipalities. We infer candidatesâ€™ immigrant background
from their names via existing machine learning classification tools. Using a difference-indifferences
strategy with a continuous treatment (change in the share of asylum seekers
per municipality), we find that candidates with an immigrant background benefit from the
arrival of relatively large numbers of asylum seekers such as in late 2015. Further results
show that this effect exists exclusively for candidates with a Southern or Eastern European
background which are culturally and ethnically relatively similar to native Germans.
