I am a PhD-Student at the chair of Social Policy and Public Economics of Prof. Zohal Hessami (Ruhr-University Bochum). My research is in local political economy, political selection, and migration. In particular, I use fine-grained data and micro-econometric mathods to establish causal relationships.
