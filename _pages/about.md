excerpt: "Sebastian Schirner, PhD-Student"
---

I am a **PhD-Student** at the Ruhr-University Bochum. I work at the chair of **Social Policy and Public Economics** of Prof. Dr. Zohal Hessami. Before starting the PhD, I was working as an economist at the Institute of the German Economy in Cologne. I hold a master's degree in Economics from the University of Cologne. 

My research is on **local political economy, political selection, and migration**. In particular, I examine the role of politician's characteristics on local spending and on electoral outcomes. I use fine-grained data and **micro-econometric methods** to establish causal relationships.
